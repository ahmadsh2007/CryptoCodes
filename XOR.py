'''
XOR is a bitwise operator which returns 0 if the bits are the same, and 1 otherwise. In textbooks the XOR operator is denoted by âŠ•, but in most challenges and programming languages you will see the caret ^ used instead.

A	B	Output
0	0	0
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	0

For longer binary numbers we XOR bit by bit: 0110 ^ 1010 = 1100. We can XOR integers by first converting the integer from decimal to binary. We can XOR strings by first converting each character to the integer representing the Unicode character.
